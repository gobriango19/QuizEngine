# QuizEngine

This a "personality quiz" engine, used to create and host quizzes similar to those on BuzzFeed or PlayBuzz. Some examples of this type of quiz include: http://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/are-you-more-friends-or-seinfeld, http://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/gooooo-planet, http://www.playbuzz.com/billyjeanpeters10/which-dr-seuss-character-is-your-mental-twin, and http://www.playbuzz.com/sambrick10/which-super-witty-tv-woman-are-you

The engine's backend is built using:
* ASP.NET MVC
* ASP.NET Web API
* Entity Framework

The engine's front-end is built using:
* Razor (including HTML and AJAX Helpers)
* Backbone
* Backbone Marionette
* RequireJS
* Bootstrap

Progress for the project can be tracked here and on my blog at: http://gobriango19.blogspot.co.nz/
